# B – TEAM / ROLE LAYER

Status: IN PROGRESS
Phase: B1 – Structural teams (no writing quality)

## Goal
Separate "what" (MODE) from "who/how" (TEAM).

## TEAM responsibilities
- model selection
- system prompt
- temperature / max_tokens
- output contract (JSON if needed)

## Out of scope for B1
- prompt quality
- literary value
- canon reasoning
- long memory
- market optimization
